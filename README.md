## E-Commerce-Store-with-Stripe-API

I build an e-commerce store with cart and payment functionalities. I have also integrated the [Stripe API](https://stripe.com/docs/api) into this application to accept payments from users for the products added to their cart. I also use the [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/) that provides data for e-commerce websites. I use it to fetch and display product categories and products themselves in the store.

I have used the Express framework on Node.js to develop the server API. After implementing the front-end components and adding payment functionality, I set up a server to process those payments. The finalized product will fetch the product data from the Fake Store API, allowing users to add products to the cart and make Stripe payments via the Node.js server.
